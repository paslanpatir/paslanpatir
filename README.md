Hi,

It's Pelin. I'm a data science & research enthusiast. I like data wrangling and modeling as much as presenting my work to others.
I love discussing and challenging points of view. Therefore, I am very keen on learning and sharing knowledge.

Probably the most important two things about me:

I am a very lucky person in terms of my family and friends.
Tango means the world to me :)
Currently, I work as a Senior Data Scientist in Odeabank. I am the first but not the least data scientist of the bank :)

Previously, I worked in Modanisa, which is the global market leader in online modest fashion and category builder. I also had a chance to work as an academic (research assistant) and data science consultant for two large retail companies in Invent Analytics.
