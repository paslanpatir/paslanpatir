Hi,

It's Pelin. I'm a data science & research enthusiast. I like data wrangling and modeling as much as presenting my work to others.   
I can discuss almost any topics. 
Can we use a basic ann as an alternative to subsampling?
What would be the pros and cons if we simply ensemble two linear and nonlinear models? 
Although jazz music emerged as a self-expression of 'black' people, how come do we listen it in cool pubs and it is mostly favored by middle-or-upper class?
What is the best policy in children's education? 

Anyways, you see I generally enjoy thinking and challenging my view of thinking. So, I like to do research and learn.

Currently, I work as a Data Scientist in Modanisa, which is the global market leader of online modest fashion and category builder. 
Previously, I had a chance to work as an academic (research assistant) and data science consultant for two large retail companies.
