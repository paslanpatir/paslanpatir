### Hi there, I'm Pelin 👋  
*Tango dancer | Senior Data Scientist | Generative AI Explorer*

I'm a **data scientist and research enthusiast** with a passion for turning ideas into models, and models into impact. I enjoy every step of the data journey — from data wrangling and feature engineering to building predictive systems and telling stories with dashboards.

Currently, I work at **Odeabank** as the **first Senior Data Scientist**, where I help shape the data science practice and build tools like **LLM-powered internal chatbots** (LLaMA, Mistral) and **deposit pricing engines** used across the bank.

Previously, I worked at **Modanisa**, where I led data projects that directly improved logistics and revenue performance, and at **Invent Analytics**, delivering analytics solutions to retail clients in Turkey and Poland. I’ve also worked in academia as a research assistant in Industrial Engineering.

### 🔬 Tech I Love
- Python, SQL, R
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, Pandas, NumPy  
- QlikSense, Tableau  
- A/B testing, experiment design, simulation modeling

### 🌟 Side Projects
- [**Runaway Guys**](https://runawayguys.streamlit.app/) — a fun little Streamlit app that lets you evaluate the “toxicity” level of ex-boyfriends. (Yes, it’s built with science, but also... with love and wit.)
